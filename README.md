# Cryptographic Algorithms

Welcome to the Cryptographic Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms in Python.

## Algorithms Included

1. [Caesar Cipher](caesarcipher.py): The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

2. [RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)](RSA.py): RSA is a public-key cryptosystem widely used for secure data transmission. It uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

3. [Playfair Cipher](playfair_cipher.py): The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters in the plaintext based on a keyword and a 5x5 grid.

4. [Monoalphabetic Cipher](monoalphabetic_cipher.py): The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a single other letter.

5. [Hill Cipher](hill_cipher.py): The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. It encrypts blocks of plaintext letters using matrix multiplication.

6. [Feistel Cipher](feistel_cipher.py): The Feistel Cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. It divides the plaintext into blocks and applies multiple rounds of a round function.

7. [Diffie-Hellman Cipher](diffie_hellman.py): The Diffie-Hellman Cipher is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

8. [DES (Data Encryption Standard) Binary Key Generator](DES_key_generation.py): DES is a symmetric-key block cipher. This program generates a random binary key for DES encryption.

9. [Vigenere Cipher](vigenere_cipher.py):The Vigen√®re cipher is a type of substitution cipher that uses multiple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers to hide the original plaintext structure. The code key specifies which substitution to use. 

10.[Eleptic Curve Cypthography](eleptic_curve_cryptography.py):Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public-key cryptography technique that uses the mathematics of elliptic curves to generate security between key pairs


## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. To run any specific algorithm, simply execute the corresponding Python script.

For example, to run the Caesar Cipher algorithm:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```
